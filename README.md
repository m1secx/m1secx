# 👋 Hi, I'm Mehmet Incealan  
**Cyber Security Engineer | SecOps • Blue Team • Detection Engineering • Automation**

I work across the full defensive security lifecycle — from detection engineering and threat intelligence, to SOC operations, EDR/EPP configuration, hybrid security architecture design, and security automation.  
My focus is building modern, scalable and automated security environments.

## 🛡️ What I Do

### 🔹 **SecOps & Hybrid Security Architecture**
- Designing hybrid security architectures (On-Prem + Cloud)  
- Positioning and integrating enterprise security products (EDR, SIEM, SOAR, VM, WAF, IAM, FW)  
- Building end-to-end security operations workflows and response pipelines  
- Conducting configuration hardening and policy optimization for EDR, EPP and SIEM platforms  

### 🔹 **Threat Detection & Response**
- Threat hunting, IOC enrichment, and active threat intelligence  
- Writing detection rules (EDR, SIEM, Sigma, MITRE ATT&CK–aligned hunts)  
- Real-time monitoring, triage, correlation and incident response  

### 🔹 **Security Automation & Engineering**
- Automating SOC workflows using Python, Rust and REST APIs  
- Developing desktop apps (widgets) and web-based dashboards for security monitoring  
- SOAR orchestration (XSOAR & custom-built playbooks)  
- Data pipelines for multi-tenant EDR/SIEM environments  

### 🔹 **LLM & Cybersecurity Research**
- Fine-tuning local LLMs for phishing detection and email analysis  
- Building prompt-generation pipelines and benchmark suites  
- Researching AI-driven detection engineering and adversarial behavior analysis  

### 🔹 **Vulnerability Management**
- Designing VMDR processes and reporting workflows  
- Operating Tenable Security Center & OpenVAS architectures  
- Triage, prioritization, remediation coordination (Ops + IT teams)
