# 👋 Hi, I'm Mehmet Incealan  
**Cyber Security Engineer | SecOps • Blue Team • Detection Engineering • Automation**

I work across the full defensive security lifecycle — from detection engineering and threat intelligence, to SOC operations, EDR/EPP configuration, hybrid security architecture design, and security automation.  
My focus is building modern, scalable and automated security environments.

## 🛡️ What I Do

### 🔹 **SecOps & Hybrid Security Architecture**
- Designing hybrid security architectures (On-Prem + Cloud)  
- Positioning and integrating enterprise-grade security products (EDR, SIEM, SOAR, VM, WAF, IAM, FW, CAASM)  
- Experience with Breach & Attack Simulation tools for security validation  
- Building end-to-end security operations workflows and automated response pipelines  
- Writing policies and managing deployment processes for browser security & LLM-security platforms  
- Conducting configuration hardening and policy optimization for EDR, EPP and SIEM platforms  

### 🔹 **Threat Detection & Response**
- Threat hunting, IOC enrichment, CTI-driven enrichment and active threat intelligence operations  
- Writing detection rules (EDR, SIEM, Sigma, MITRE ATT&CK–aligned hunts)  
- Real-time monitoring, triage, correlation, incident validation and response  
- Operating network & infrastructure monitoring platforms and log analytics tools  

### 🔹 **Security Automation & Engineering**
- Automating SOC workflows using Python, Rust and REST APIs  
- Developing desktop applications and web dashboards to streamline security operations  
- SOAR orchestration (custom playbooks, enrichment chains, automated remediation)  
- Email security automation: phishing analysis pipelines using sandboxing, gateway policies, header analysis and automated playbooks  
- Building multi-tenant data pipelines for large-scale EDR/SIEM environments  

### 🔹 **LLM & Cybersecurity Research**
- Fine-tuning local LLMs for phishing detection, email classification and anomaly analysis  
- Building prompt-generation pipelines and benchmark suites for model comparison  
- Researching adversarial behavior, AI-driven detection engineering and secure deployment of LLM ecosystems  

### 🔹 **Vulnerability Management**
- Designing VMDR processes and operational workflows  
- Running vulnerability scanning & exposure management platforms  
- Coordinating triage, prioritization and remediation across Ops/IT teams  
- Experience with AD security posture assessment tools (misconfigurations, risky paths, certificates, privilege escalation vectors)
