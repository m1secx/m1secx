# 👋 Hi, I'm Mehmet Incealan  
**Cyber Security Engineer | SecOps • Blue Team • Detection Engineering • Automation**

I work across the full defensive security lifecycle — from detection engineering and threat intelligence, to SOC operations, EDR/EPP configuration, hybrid security architecture design, and security automation.  
My focus is building modern, scalable and automated security environments.

## 🛡️ What I Do

### 🔹 SecOps & Hybrid Security Architecture
- Designing hybrid security architectures (On-Prem + Cloud)  
- Positioning and integrating enterprise-grade security products (EDR, SIEM, SOAR, VM, WAF, IAM, FW, CAASM)  
- Experience with Breach & Attack Simulation tools for security validation  
- Writing policies & managing deployments for browser security and LLM-security platforms  
- End-to-end SecOps workflow design and automated incident response pipelines  
- Hardening and policy optimization for EDR, EPP and SIEM platforms  

### 🔹 Threat Detection & Response
